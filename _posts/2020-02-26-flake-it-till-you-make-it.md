## What is Computer Science for me?
Computer Science program started for me back in 2016. I went in local community college and received a Computer Science associates degree. Unfortunately while I was in school there was no help to find jobs and I had a little knowledge how to get in the field. I kept studying and was a straight A student, but still had no knowledge or idea of who I want to be. Then I decided to go for my graduate program in SNHU and after first semester I got a job in IT. This semester will be my last in Computer Science and I will start my journey to Cybersecurity.


During the program there was a lot of ups and downs. The three skills will be patience, asking questions, and reading the instructions. I named patience first because not everything will be working from the first try, and I needed to start over a project multiple times during this program. Asking questions is my go to, I will be posting questions to other students in general discussion, I will be emailing the professor if I need help at any time. Reading the instructions for the assignments through is a very important skill for me. I used to only read the requirements and then I found out that there is usually much more than requirements and I was missing a lot of things in some classes.

## What is my ePortfolio?
For my ePortfolio I am contemplating on which of the past work to display. The CS 350 course project will be used for ePortfolio. I used a code from scratch for TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL board. The program was written to create a thermostat by using GPIO, UART, I2C peripherals. This project has two artifacts from categories design and databases. 


This project from CS 350 course will demonstrate the skills I have acquires in software engineering and design because of the number of elements used, the structure of the code and analysis. Currently the application is able to set the temperature and to turn on/off the heating system. It is designed to add more features to the board. My plan for this artifact will be to enhance more functions to the project such as connect the device to the Wi-Fi. IoT device will collect data, then it will take the data by using the hub or IoT gateway to collate and transfer the data, and then it will analyze data and take further action by using user interface or aback end systems. This enhancement will illustrate software design and show future employees that I have experience working with IoT.
